# DNA-origami

Code in-progress for Gang Lab

**Goal:** Find minimum unique voxels and bond colors to create a desired unit cell.

## To test the current code:
Currently, only a simple GUI is implemented. There is no scrollbar so it's only sufficient for small designs :(

To test, go to the `origami.ipynb` file and run the cells. You should see a GUI pop up, fill in the desired design information 
and it will save the output as a file containing a numpy array in `lattice.npy`. This is loaded in the next cell, where we can
start the algorithm! (For later)
